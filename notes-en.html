        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, use the following modifications:

        * Copy over learner files onto all computers (link on Welcome slide).
        * Ensure that [Arduino Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is installed on all computers.
        * Skip working with the Registry.
        * Spend more time sharing projects. Have learners bring their laptops to the front to share on the projector.
        * Please remind learners to save often!


        <br>
        #Notes:

        **Introductions (Slide 3):**

        Have mentors stand up and introduce themselves with their name and pronouns.

        Have learners introduce themselves to their table groups and answer an icebreaker question, for example: "If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"

        **Arduino (Slide 11):**

        Allow the learners to go ahead and open up arduino boxes and take a look

        * What does it look like?

        **Arduino (Slide 12):**

        This board contains a microcontroller which is able to be programmed to sense and control objects in the physical world. By responding to sensors and inputs, the Arduino is able to interact with a large array of outputs such as LEDs, motors and displays.

        Because of its flexibility and low cost, Arduino has become a very popular choice for makers and makerspaces looking to create interactive hardware projects.

        **(Slide 13):**

        Clockwise,

        * LilyPad is designed to be easily sewn into e-textiles and wearable projects
        * Arduino Pro Mini is made for small form factor projects
        * Arduino Uno is the most popular with just enough features to create anything
        * Arduino Due is much more powerful with lesser power consumption
        * Arduino Pro Micro is even smaller

        **(Slide 14):**

        Legend,

        * 1 - Reset Button – This will restart any code that is loaded to the Arduino board.
        * 3 & 14 - Ground Pin – There are a few ground pins on the Arduino and they all work the same.
        * 4 & 12 & 13 - Digital Input/Output – Pins 0-13 can be used for digital input or output.
        * 6 - USB Connection – Used for powering up your Arduino and uploading sketches.
        * 7 - TX/RX – Transmit and receive data indication LEDs.
        * 8 - ATmega Microcontroller – This is the brains and is where the programs are stored.
        * 9 - Power LED Indicator – This LED lights up anytime the board is plugged into a power source.
        * 11 - DC Power Barrel Jack – This is used for powering your Arduino with a power supply.

        **(Slide 15):**

        Allow time to discuss in pairs.

        * What is a circuit?
        * What is an example of a circuit?

        **(Slide 16):**

        What is an electron?

        * They flow through the circuit. The circuit must be closed for them to travel along the path. i.e., a light switch.

        **(Slide 18):**

        Allow time to discuss in pairs.

        What do I need to build a circuit?

        * Power/battery, output, wires/conductors for electricity to travel on i.e., copper

        **(Slide 22):**

        * Switch, Lightbulb, Battery, electron flow counterclockwise
        * Schematics may be complicated and taunting

        **(Slide 23):**

        Practice calculation with the learners

        * The image indicates 47k ohms

        What is the resistance of the ones we are using?

        * Answer, 770 ohms; there is a gap before the last band for the tolerance

        **(Slide 24):**

        Can you think of other examples of an Output?

        * Fan, motors, speakers, etc.


        **(Slide 25):**

        Ask the learners what the outcome of this practice would be and proceed with the challenge.

        Paper print out guidelines, http://blog.fritzing.org/2009/12/02/paper-templates-for-your-breadboard-prototypes/

        **(Slide 28):**

        The difference between a maintained and momentary button, "maintained" will keep its state and "momentary" would would not, which would require a mechanism to hold it down.

        **(Slide 30):**

        Ask the learners what the outcome of this practice would be and proceed with the challenge.

        Note about getting into the habit of building, taking a video/mini celebration, then taking it apart again. Point out which parts we can leave and which parts we need to remove and add new components to.

        **(Slide 31):**

        Allow time to debug.

        Tell learners that this circuit won’t light up or do anything yet - we need to give it instructions first.

        **(Slide 36)**

        If the learner sign in with a Google account, he/she will need to:

        * Click “Create a new sketch”
        * A bar will pop up with install plugin
        * Click “help”
        * Click “install plugin”

        **(Slide 38)**

        We’ll be working in here.  Look at starter code. Point out what a comment is.

        **(Slide 40)**

        The return type `void` does not return a value.

        **(Slide 41):**

        Point out semicolon - needed at the end of each line of code.

        We are adding this code to the top of the project - above the setup function.

        Remember to zoom in on the code for everyone to see.

        **(Slide 41):**

        Check to see if these are the pin numbers we are actually plugged into on our Arduino.

        **(Slide 43):**

        Documentation is an important part of programming. The people who made the C/C++ language set specific rules/parameters. We don’t need to memorize them, we just need to know where to find this info.

        Walkthrough on how to read an official documentation provided by Arduino using the provided links.

        **(Slide 47):**

        Pseudocode = What does our program need to know?

        Emphasize the human instructions in the previous slide.

        1. Is the button pressed?
        1. If so, turn on light.
        1. If not, turn off.

        **(Slide 49):**

        Point out curly brackets - indicates nesting.

        * TIP: Type in both curly brackets at the same time to make sure we don’t forget one, then space them out to add code.

        Why do we indent code? To organize it, to indicate flow.

        **(Slide 51):**

        What does else mean/do? It tells the program what to do for all other scenarios.

        **(Slide 53):**

        Make a mistake on purpose to show what an error looks like.

        **(Slide 56):**

        * Ask the mentors to put colour stickies on the learners laptops to indicate which challenge they decided to take on.
        * They each have 10 minutes to come up with the solution.
        * 5 minutes to share their solution with their neighbour(s)
        * Regroup to go over the final solutions and discuss as a group on what are some differences

        **(Slide 62):**

        Discuss industry connections with the ideas came up by the learners.

        **(Slide 65):**

        Point out materials we haven’t used yet.

        * What is an ultrasonic range finder? A: sensor. Shoots out a radio wave and measures how long it takes for it to bounce back.

        **(Slide 66):**

        Reviewing and setting up range sensor.  Remind to program it with the three step process to program on [Slide 52](slides-en.html#slide52)

        Video on how to wire the buzzer, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8AnlUT0ng0

        **(Slide 67):**

        Challenge the learners to figure out the code by only providing them with the pseudocode.

        Mention answer will be provided later [(Slide 72)](slides-en.html#slide72), so don't worry.

        **(Slide 68):**

        Encourage individual group ownership of the project on how they decorate or disguise the device.  The example given is an anti-lunch-burglar system.  Some other examples could be a dog house, watch owl, or even a robot butler.

        **(Slide 71):**

        Demo in a science fair style

        * Get 2 out of 4 members of the team to showcase at their station and 2 of them to go around and checkout others
        * Switch in 15-20 min (time to tour 4 other groups)
        * Regroup on findings and ask if the learners still have questions

        **(Slide 75):**

        Treat the Take-Home Exercise as a stretch goal if you have any time remaining.
